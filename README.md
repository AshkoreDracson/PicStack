# PicStack

Stack your burst shots easily for noise reduction and increased exposure.

## To use

PicStack is still very barebones and assumes the following things when stacking your photos.

- That all photos are the same size
- That your scene is framed the same way (To avoid ghosting)
- That you do not blend more parts than there are photos.
- Try to divide into parts evenly, or some pictures will be skipped!

PicStack is still:

- Very resource heavy
- Poorly optimized

Takes a minute to blend 32 burst shots on any setting on an i5-3570k and 16GB RAM, memory usage is ~3GB for such a task, may highly vary depending on how many burst shots you imported.
